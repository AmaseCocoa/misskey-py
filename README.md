# misskey-py
Experimental re-implementation of the Misskey backend using Python.
## What is this?
This is a re-implementation of the Misskey backend using FastAPI/Python. It is being developed out of the personal interest of one Misskey user and may be more immature than the official Node backend. It may also be slower than the official implementation.
